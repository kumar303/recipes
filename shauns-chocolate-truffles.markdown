Shaun's Chocolate Truffles
==========================

- 12oz Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips
- 1/2C + 2T Heavy Whipping Cream
- 1/4C Grand Mariner
- Cocoa powder

Pour the chocolate chips into a metal mixing bowl.

Warm the whipping cream over medium heat until simmering.
Do not simmer for more than 1 or 2 seconds; mix into chocolate.
Continue mixing until all chips have melted.  If necessary,
suspend the metal bowl over a pot of mildly boiling water; do
not allow the steam to mix with the chocolate.

Once all chocolate has melted, mix in the Grand Mariner.  Stir
slowly until the chocolate has a shiny appearance.  Once alcohol
is added the chocolate may not be reheated.

Let the chocolate cool to room temperature.  Then, place
uncovered in a refrigerator until slightly cooled.  Take out of
fridge, cover with a lid or saran wrap and return to fridge.
Allow chocolate to chill.  (This is done in steps to prevent
condensation from forming on the chocolate, bowl, or lid)

Once chilled, with a melon baller or teaspoon, scoop out small
mounds of chocolate and place them on a cookie sheet covered with
wax paper.  Return to fridge to chill.

Place a small amount of cocoa powder in a small shallow bowl.
Take out chocolate and roll each truffle into a small ball with
your hands, then roll the ball in the cocoa powder until lightly
dusted.

If truffles are firm, place each into a bowl for storage in the
refrigerator; otherwise return to cookie sheet to cool.

Done!
