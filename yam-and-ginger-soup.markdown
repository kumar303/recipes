Yam and Ginger Soup
===================

Ingredients
-----------
 - 2-3 large yams, about 2 lbs
 - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
 - 1 medium to large onion chopped fine
 - 2 tsps salt, or to taste
 - 1/2 tsp black pepper
 - 3 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
 - 3 cups of chicken or vegetable stock
 - 1 cup Silk soy creamer (or if you're into a heavier soup: 1 cup heavy cream).
   With soy creamer, be careful not to get sweetened
   creamer because it will add too much sugar.
 - juice of 1/2 lime

Instructions
------------
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake yams until thoroughly soft (1 hour). (I also microwave them for about 6-8 minutes for 2 yams.)  When yams are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into slices.
 2. Melt butter over medium-low heat in a large stock pot. Cook onions with salt and pepper until soft, about 10 minutes.
 3. Add ginger and cook an additional 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 4. Add yams and chicken/veg stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes.
 5. Puree in a blender until smooth. Strain back into the pot and stir in cream and half and half. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Stir in lime juice and serve immediately.

Serves 4-6 servings
