Cajun Eggy Toast
================

- 1 egg
- 1 piece of rye bread
- couple slices of well aged, extra sharp cheddar
- unsalted cajun powder (paprika, onion, garlic, black pepper, lemon peel, chile, allspice, thyme, cloves, mace, cayenne, bay leaf)
- veganaise (or mayo if you're into that)
- tomato
- black pepper

Fry the egg and melt the cheese on top.  Sprinkle with cajun powder.  Toast the rye and spread lightly with veganaise.  Top the toast with egg and some slices of tomato.  Grind black pepper over the tomato slices and serve.
