Fontina Toastie
===============

- 3 eggs, yolks removed
- 8 slices of Italian Fontina cheese
- 8 slices of tomato
- vegennaise spread
- Za'atar seasoning
- 2 slices of rye bread, toasted

Fry the egg whites while the bread is toasting then split the fried egg pancake in two.  Spread the veggenaise on the two slices of toast, top each with egg pancake, cheese and tomato slices.  Sprinkle Za'atar on top and enjoy.  Note that substituting any of these ingredients will probably make a tasty sandwich but it won't be a Fontina Toastie!
