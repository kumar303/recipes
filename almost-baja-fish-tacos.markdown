Almost Baja Fish Tacos
======================

The White Sauce
---------------
 * 1/4 cup mayo
 * 2 tbsp rice milk (or regular milk if you're into that)
 * 1 tbsp lime juice
 * 1/4 tsp celery salt (can sub. garlic salt, etc)

The Batter
----------
 * 1/2 c flour
 * 1/4 c baking powder
 * 2 egg whites
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 1/2 c beer (Tecate!)
 * 1/2 c water
 * 1 tsp chili powder (a paprika, salt, garlic salt mix)
 * 2 tsp parsley

The Goods
---------
 * 1 lb. cod fillet
 * 2 c shredded cabbage, chopped fine
 * 1/4 c cilantro, chopped fine
 * Lime for squeezing
 * 8 corn (or flour) tortillas
 * 1/2 c peanut oil

Instructions 
------------
 1. Mix all white sauce ingredients together and set aside
 2. Now make the batter.  Separate eggs and beat until frothy and light (not too much).
 3. Fold all batter ingredients together until smooth.  If you want it thicker add a little more flour or add beer to make it thinner.
 4. Cut cod pieces into small chunks so they will fit well in a taco (batter adds about 1/2 an inch all around).
 5. Fill a pan half full with peanut oil and heat until approx. 375 F
 6. Fill a bowl with about a cup of flour and keep it next to the batter bowl.  Dip a cod piece first into the flour then into the batter.  Fry for 4-5 minutes, turing halfway through.  You may want to drain them on a paper towel to get rid of some oil afterwards.
 7. Now fix up some tacos.  Steam a tortilla, spread white sauce all over it, add some fish, add cabbage, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.  Repeat.
 8. [Optional] Imagine you are sitting on the beach somewhere south of San Felipe, eating fresh fish tacos from a push cart.
 
Makes about 8 fish tacos.  Some people say you need to let the batter sit but I don't know what that does.  If you have time, chill it for 3 to 6 hours apparently.
