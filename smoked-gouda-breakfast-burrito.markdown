Smoked Gouda Breakfast Burrito
==============================

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 burrito-size flour tortillas
* 1 can of black beans (in water, salted)
* 6 slices Gimme Lean(tm) sausage, cut into quarters
* 1/4 onion, chopped
* 1 clove garlic
* 3 or 4 button mushrooms, chopped in quarters
* 6 slices of smoked gouda cheese
* 1 tomato, chopped
* 4-5 tbsp salsa verde (like Trader Jose's, mmmm)
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp cumin
* pepper

Instructions
------------
1. Saute the onions until translucent.  Add the sausage.  Continue to saute until sausage is just golden.
2. Add the beans, mushrooms, and garlic.  Keep cooking on medium heat 
3. Mix up the eggs (optionally, remove the yolks) with the cumin and some pepper in a glass
4. In a separate pan, fry the egg (or scramble, however you like it)
5. Heat a tortilla and build a burrito like so : Lay on half the bean mix, lay over 3 slices of smoked gouda (enough to cover), cut out half the egg and lay it down, sprinkle on half the chopped tomatoes, spread salsa verde on top (about 2-3 tablespoons), and wrap it up.
6. Eat.
