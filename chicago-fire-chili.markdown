Chicago Fire Chili
==================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 15oz (425g) can of diced tomatoes, unsalted
- 3 15oz (425g) cans of chili beans (black, pinto, kidney)
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 onion
- half a beer (stout or dark ale)
- beef or chicken broth as needed (at least a cup)
- 1 pound of ground bison (or grass fed ground beef)
- 2 Thai chili peppers
- 1-2 bay leaves
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- chili powder
- spices of your choosing
- salt, pepper

Instructions
------------
- Chop the onion and bell pepper into squares, dice the garlic, dice the thai chili peppers.
- Completely drain the beans in a strainer and rinse.
- Fry the onions over medium heat in a large pot until soft.
- Add spices of your choosing. I've been really liking the
  [Sunny Oaxaca Ancho-Coffee Rub](http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/sunny-oaxaca-salt-free-ancho-coffee-rub)
  but you could also use freshly ground cumin and coriander.
- Add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.
- Stir in the bell peppers and mix until slightly soft.
- Add the tomatoes and the drained beans and use a little broth to cover.
- Mix in the beer, salt, pepper, bay leaves, chili powder, thai chili peppers, and the lemon juice.
- Bring it to a boil and then simmer with a lid on for about an hour. Stir often
  so it doesn't stick to the bottom. Use the broth to keep the liquid up if
  needed.
- Take the lid off and boil down the liquid until it starts to thicken.
- This would be a good time to taste it and make adjustments
- Add the ground beef, stirring continuously, and keep cooking until done.
- Keep boiling and stirring until it's as thick as you want it.

Serves 6 - 8
