Lemon Butter Halibut
====================

Ingredients
-----------
 - 1 lb halibut
 - 4 tbsp butter
 - 4 tbsp dry vermouth
 - juice of 1/2 lemon
 - fresh dill, finely chopped
 - sea salt
 - 6-8 shallots
 - 1/2 cup (dry) quinoa
 - handful of brussel sprouts

Instructions
------------
 1. Add salt to halibut while you prepare everything else.
 2. Start the quinoa and brussel sprouts separately.  
 3. Slice each shallot in quarters, saute with the butter.  
 4. Add the vermouth, lemon juice, halibut, salt, dill and saute for about 1 minute.   
 5. Turn, cover and finish cooking on the other side, for a total cooking time (over low heat) of about 8-9 minutes per inch of thickness of the fish.  (Start with the lower amount; overcooked halibut is dry and stringy; cook until flaky and tender.)  
 6. Drizzle the juice from the halibut over the quinoa and brussel sprouts and eat!
