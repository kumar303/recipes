Chicago Fire Chili
==================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 28oz (794g) can of diced tomatoes, unsalted
- 3 15oz (425g) cans of chili beans (black, pinto, kidney)
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 onion
- half a beer (stout or dark ale)
- beef broth as needed (at least 2 cups)
- 1 pound of ground bison (or grass fed ground beef)
- 2 Thai chili peppers
- 1-2 bay leaves
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- chili powder
- spices of your choosing
- salt, pepper

Instructions
------------
- Chop the onion and bell pepper into squares, dice the garlic, dice the thai chili peppers.
- Fry the onions over medium heat in a large pot until soft.
- Add spices of your choosing. I've been really liking the
  [Sunny Oaxaca Ancho-Coffee Rub](http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/sunny-oaxaca-salt-free-ancho-coffee-rub)
  but you could also use freshly ground cumin and coriander.
- Add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.
- Mix in the tomatoes (including the liquid), beer, salt, pepper, bell peppers,
  bay leaves, chili powder, thai chili peppers, the lemon juice,
  and add some broth to cover.
- Bring it to a boil and then simmer. This is the base and you can cook it for
  as long as you want to get the right flavor. Stir often
  so it doesn't stick to the bottom. Use the broth to keep the liquid up if
  needed.
- While it's simmering, completely drain the beans in a strainer and rinse.
- Add the beans and cook for about 5 minutes
- This would be a good time to taste it and make adjustments
- Add the ground beef, stirring continuously, and keep cooking until done.
- Keep boiling and stirring until it's as thick as you want it. If it gets too
  thick, use the broth to thin it out.

Serves 6 - 8
