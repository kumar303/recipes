Lemon Lamb Tagine
=================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 lbs lamb shoulder, chopped into 1 inch pieces
- 1 400g (large) can of diced tomatoes
- 1 tsp ginger, minced
- 2 - 3 small potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 c frozen peas (run under cold water to defrost slightly)
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tsp ground cardamom (discard the pods)
- 1/2 tsp saffron (soaked in cold water)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp cayenne
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- salt & pepper
- 1/2 preserved lemon, rinsed, quartered and sliced
- 12 black olives, rinsed
- 1/4 c cilantro, chopped
- 1 3/4 c coucous

Saut√© oil, onions, and ginger in the tagine pot, uncovered, until onions are soft.  Add lamb, salt, pepper, saffron, and stir until lamb begins to turn brown.  Add potatoes, tomatoes (with juice from the can), all remaining spices, and simmer covered for about 30 minutes.  Add sliced preserved lemon, olives, and continue cooking covered until lamb is tender; this will probably take around 45 minutes.  Add the peas and prepare the coucous towards the end.  

Serve over couscous and garnish with fresh cilantro.  (Serves 3 - 4.)
