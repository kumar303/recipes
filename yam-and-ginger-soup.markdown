Yam and Ginger Soup
===================

Ingredients
-----------
* 2-3 large yams, about 2 lbs
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 medium to large onion chopped fine
* 2 tsps salt, or to taste
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 3 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
* 3 cups of chicken stock
* 1 cup heavy cream
* juice of 1/2 lime

Instructions
------------
 1. Preheat oven to 350F and bake yams until thoroughly soft (1 hour). When yams are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into slices.
 2. Melt butter over medium-low heat in a large stock pot. Cook onions with salt and pepper until soft, about 10 minutes.
 3. Add ginger and cook an additional 3 minutes.
 4. Add yams and chicken stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes.
 5. Puree in a blender (or use an immersion blender in the pot) until smooth.
 6. Optional: pass the soup through a strainer. This is time consuming but the soup ends up more velvety and you won't get any ginger strings.
 7. Stir in the heavy cream. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. You might want to start with a portion of the cream and taste it. Too much cream will kill the ginger kick which is essential.
 8. Stir in lime juice, adjust salt, and serve immediately.
