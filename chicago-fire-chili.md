Chicago Fire Chili
==================

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 28oz (794g) can of diced tomatoes, unsalted
- 3 15oz (425g) cans of chili beans (black, pinto, kidney)
- 2-3 garlic cloves, diced or pressed
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- half a beer (stout or dark ale)
- beef broth (2-4 cups)
- 1 pound of grass fed ground beef
- 2 Thai chili peppers, diced
- 1-2 bay leaves
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- [Oaxacan Ancho Coffee Rub](http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/sunny-oaxaca-salt-free-ancho-coffee-rub) (or other spices)
- pinch of ground coffee
- salt

Instructions
------------
- Fry the onions over medium heat in a large pot until soft.
- Stir in the Oaxacan Ancho Coffee Rub.
- Add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.
- Mix in the tomatoes (including the liquid), beer, bell peppers,
  bay leaves, Thai chili peppers, lemon juice, a pinch of coffee,
  and cover with broth.
- Bring it to a boil and then simmer. This is the base and you can cook it for
  as long as you want to get the right flavor. Stir often
  so it doesn't stick to the bottom. Use the broth to keep the liquid up if
  needed.
- While it's simmering, completely drain the beans and rinse.
- When you think your base is ready, add the beans and cook for about 5 minutes
- Add the ground beef, stirring continuously, and keep cooking until done.
- Keep boiling and stirring until it's as thick as you want it. If it gets too
  thick, use the broth to thin it out.
- Add salt to taste.
